    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>Hello! My name is Muhammad Harith Bin Salih Kamil, and I was born on April 10, 2004. As I reflect on my life thus far, I realize that my journey has been shaped by my passions, aspirations, and the experiences that have molded me into the person I am today. One of my most significant ambitions is to become an IT expert, a goal that drives me to learn, grow, and explore the vast world of technology.</p>
